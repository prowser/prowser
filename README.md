# prowser (alias f***.js)
Prowser is a next generation browser with native Python support which aims to start a new era which will mark the beginning of JavaScript's end. It aims to bring JavaScript to the gallows and after that carry it to a grave, bury it and let developers all around the world forget that JS ever existed. Then a new epoch of JavaScript-free web & mobile development - no! software development in general - will begin and everybody - dev, ops, qa **_and_** biz - will be happy!


# Invocation
~~Proletarians~~ Pythonistas of all countries, unite! We don't have nothing to lose but the ugliness and the pain of JavaScript! Joint this project and make a mankind's dream come true! The best way to predict the future is to create it!

> **Disclaimer:** This is not a joke! I am totally serious about this - no, really!
